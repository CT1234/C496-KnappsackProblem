# COMP496-DynamicProgramming

##Project 2 Description##

Task: Recall the Knapsack problem where the goal was to choose a set of items which maximized the total
value of the items while keeping the total weight of the items less than the given limit. You are to program
the dynamic programming algorithm shown in class for this problem. The input will be given in a file called
ksinstance.txt. The first line will be one integer representing the weight limit and each subsequent line will be
two integers seperated by whitespace representing one item.

**Sample Interaction:**

Reading ksinstance.txt
The best set of items is:
1, 5, 6, 9, 11
It has a total value 32 and total weight 21.
